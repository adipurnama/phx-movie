## Intro

This project is rewrite of this [excellent PHP Laravel + Livewire tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OKbmMqsREc&list=PLEhEHUEU3x5pYTjZze3fhYMB4Nl_WOHI4) project.
Since `laravel livewire` is inspired by `phoenix liveview`, I figured I can
also follow along using the elixir+phoenix stack.

The live version can be seen [here](http://phx-movie.gigalixirapp.com)

## Setup

This app requires [themoviedb API](https://themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
Get your API Key & export it as TMDB_API_KEY environment variable.
```bash
export TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
